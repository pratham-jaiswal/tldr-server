# TLDR AI

TL;DR AI helps users quickly understand lengthy articles, papers, and content by generating concise summaries. Our goal is to make information more accessible and easier to consume.

## How It Works

TL;DR AI offers two ways to generate summaries:
- From a URL: Paste a link and get a summary of its content.
- From Text: Enter text manually to generate a concise summary.

## AI Model Options

Users can choose between:
- OpenAI GPT-4o mini
- Cohere Command R

## Saved Summaries

- Users can save generated TL;DRs when using the URL option.
- Users can opt to fetch a saved summary, which is retrieved if available in our database.

## Rate Limits

- Users are limited to 2 AI-generated TL;DRs per 6 hours.
- Fetching a previously saved summary does not count towards this limit.

## Why Choose TL;DR AI?
- Quick and accurate summarization using top AI models.
- Save and retrieve summaries from our database for future reference.
- Flexible options for generating summaries from URLs or text.
- Optimized for efficiency with minimal rate limitations.

**TL;DR:** Summarize content instantly with AI-powered summaries.
